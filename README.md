# functions.py
just a list of functions to use in python 33
for now there is only 1 function which is the alert function.
for those of you who used BGT, a language for audiogames, this will not be to hard to understand.
just do as follows:
import functions
#to output the text to the screen:
functions.alert("hi", "this is just some stupid example of some stupid messagebox.")
